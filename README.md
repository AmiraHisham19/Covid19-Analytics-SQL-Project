# COVID-19 Data Exploration and Analysis (SQL Server)

## Project Overview
A comprehensive SQL-based analysis of global COVID-19 trends, integrating death statistics and vaccination data to calculate critical public health metrics

## Objective
To analyze the global impact of COVID-19 by calculating infection rates, mortality ratios, and vaccination coverage across populations, enabling data-driven insights 

## Dataset

Source: COVID-19 Deaths and Vaccinations datasets
Scope: Global country-level and continent-level data

Key Analyses Performed
1. Mortality Analysis

- Death Percentage by Location: Calculated daily death rates (deaths/cases × 100) to track lethality over time
- Country-Specific Tracking: Focused analysis on Egypt to demonstrate location-based filtering
- Global Death Statistics: Aggregated worldwide death counts and percentages

2. Infection Rate Analysis

- Population Infection Percentage: Tracked what proportion of each country's population contracted COVID-19
- Highest Infection Rates: Identified countries with peak infection rates relative to population size
- Temporal Trends: Monitored infection spread patterns across time periods

3. Analysis by Geography

- Country-Level Death Counts: Ranked countries by total deaths to identify most affected nations
- Continental Breakdown: Aggregated death statistics by continent for regional comparisons

4. Vaccination Coverage Analysis

- Cumulative Vaccination Tracking: Used window functions to calculate running totals of vaccinations by location
- Vaccination Percentage: Computed percentage of population vaccinated over time
